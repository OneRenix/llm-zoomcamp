# LLM Zoomcamp – My Learning Roadmap

Welcome to my personal repository for the [DataTalksClub LLM Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/)! This repo will serve as my learning journal, homework tracker, and project portfolio as I progress through the course.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

The LLM Zoomcamp is a hands-on bootcamp focused on Large Language Models (LLMs), including their foundations, practical use, and deployment. My goal is to complete all lectures, assignments, and projects, documenting my journey and learnings here.

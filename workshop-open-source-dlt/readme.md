# 🧠 Open-Source Data Ingestion with `dlt` for RAG | LLM Zoomcamp Workshop Homework

This is a **Google Colab notebook** that walks you through building data ingestion pipeline using the open-source `dlt` (Data Load Tool) library and QDrant as vector database.

> 📍 Part of the [LLM Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp) course — [Workshop: Open-Source Data Ingestion using dlt for ingesting data for RAG](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2025/workshops/dlt.md)

## 📘 What You'll Learn

✅ How to:

Notes:
- `dlt` is an open source data pipeline that automatically turns data from different data sources (API, Structured and Semi Structured data, Python data structures) into a live dataset stored in a destination of your choices. You can easily implement your own sources, as long as you yield data in a way that is compatible with dlt, such as JSON objects, Python lists and dictionaries, pandas dataframes, and arrow tables. `dlt` will be able to automatically compute the schema and move the data to your destination.
- A resource in `dlt` is an (optionally async) function that yields data. To create a resource, we add the @dlt.resource decorator to that function.
  - name: The name of the table generated by this resource. Defaults to the decorated function name.
  - write_disposition: How should the data be loaded at the destination? Currently supported: append, replace, and merge. Defaults to append.`
- The `last_trace` provides detailed information about the execution of each step in the pipeline, including start and completion times, status, and any loaded packages. This is useful for debugging and understanding the pipeline's execution flow.
- The `meta.json` file in Qdrant is a crucial configuration file that stores metadata about your Qdrant instance, including collection names, vector configurations (size, distance metric), sharding, replication, and optimization settings.

## 🧪 Homework Tasks

✅ Complete the following in this colab notebook:
- [ ] Question 1. dlt Version: What's the version of dlt that you installed?
- [ ] Question 2. dlt pipeline: How many rows were inserted into the zoomcamp_data collection?
- [ ] Question 3. Embeddings: When inserting the data, an embedding model was used. Which one?
